The program takes input of vector as individual components[0 1 2] as x y z .
The program outputs a scatter plot of stereographic projections and contour plots of normalised distribution(this part is not giving correct results.)
The program also generates random quarternions for random orientations . 
If you want to give a CSV file of orientations uncomment the part of code as indicated in the program.
If you don't have any csv file you can run the program directly for randomly generated quaternions. 
I have done this because generation random quarternions is generally more easy to do than having a number of orientations for having contour plots.
Testing is done visually for Goss and Brass component.
